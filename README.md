# Project-three : Spotlight
# Overview

Spotlight is an application that gives users option to check out reviews about certain items or merchandise that they like to purchase while also giving them the ability to add a review of their own. Users will be given the ability to search for any product and find reviews for them from other users so that they donâ€™t have to look up those specific products on eCommerce sites. Ad revenue will be generated by rendering ads on the sides of the page.
